 ## Versioning

To clarify for myself and others, here is the versioning scheme used by Taskboard as of version v0.3.0 (for versions prior, it was basically just make it up as I went along):

Versions are defined in three parts; major, minor and revision. For example, v0.3.0 is Major 0, Minor 3, Revision 0.

 * Major version numbers change in two cases:'
 * v1.0.0 is when I feel TaskBoard is *Production Ready*
 * When changes are made that add significant new features or break some form of compatibility with previous versions (e.g. requiring a new database)

Minor version numbers change when a chosen set of changes are ready for use. The changes are issues reported by users or added by myself for tracking planned features.

Revision version numbers change when a bug is reported that needs to be fixed before another minor version is released.
